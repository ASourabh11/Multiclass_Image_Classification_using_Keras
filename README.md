# Multiclass_Image_Classification_using_Keras
In this project I have used dataset of Tomato leaf images from kaggle. This dataset contains 17943 training images and 4487 test images, which are classified in 10 categories To train this model I have used Convolutional neral network With CNN I have achieved 91% training accuracy in image classification After training and validation of model I have predicted the results for new images directly from Google.
